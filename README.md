# Python-Web-Scraper
This project will be the first web scraping project I will do which will hopefully lead to other future projects with this technology.

 - script.py - starting file of the tutorialk where I test basic web scraping functions on the google homepage
 - white-house-briefings.py - second file of the tutorial where I scrape the article links from the US government's statement website
 - beautiful-soup-object.py - filled with functions for the beautiful soup object. Copy pasted from original video since it requires memorisation, and it would be best to leave it for future use rather than memorising all of the funcitons.
